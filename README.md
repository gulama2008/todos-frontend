## Features

- This todos application has two sections: a side bar, which contains all the categories and the status of completed or in progress with the number of todos under each category and status, and the todo list part which shows all the todos or the todos under a particular category or status: 
![overview](./src/assets/overview.png)
- For the categories section, the user can click the "+" to add category, or click "x" to delete a category. Once a category is deleted, all the todos which previously belong to this category will fall into the "Not categorised" category.   
![category](./src/assets/category.png)
- When adding a new category, after click the "+", there will be a input box showing on the top, the user can simply press enter or click anywhere on the screen to add a new category, then the new category will be shown in the categories section with a number of todos 0. Also the user can quit the adding anytime by press the Esc key, the input box will disappear after pressing the Esc key.

- By default, the "All" category will be selected and all the todos will be shown in the todo list sections. The user can click any category to see the particular todos under this category
![choose](./src/assets/choose.png)
- The "Status" section is showing the todos which are in progress and completed, so when select the checkbox of a todo to make it checked, it will be automatically shown under the "Completed" list

- In the todo list section, each todo has its complete checkbox, content, category and edit icons in the line. By clicking the checkbox, a todo will be made completed. The three icons on the right are copy, delete and edit. By clicking the edit icon, the line will be turn into editable mode, the content and the category will become input box and select box, which users can make edit to it, and the edit icon itself will also change to a save icon so that the user can save the updates after editing.

- This project has been deployed on aws so speed-wise it is doing well

## Future Goals

- Add test
